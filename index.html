        During my sophomore year of high school, we were doing silent work and my history teacher
        said that We could listen to music but if it Was too loud he would "break our headphones," so I'm doing my work quietly with my music on low, and this obnoxious kid sitting next to me had his music really loud. I could hear it over my music but ignored it. My teacher thought it was me. So he comes up to me & ripped my BRAND NEW Apple headphones, looking ruthless. He
        suddenly realized it was the guy next to me and he was completely embarrassed He came in
        the next day with a new pair and an apology note taped to them, He couldn't look me in the eye for the rest Of the year.
